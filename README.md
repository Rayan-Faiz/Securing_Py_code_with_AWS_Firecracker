# Firecracker MicroVM

## Overview

Firecracker is an open-source virtualization technology that provides a lightweight and secure environment for running cloud-based workloads. It is designed specifically for running microservices and functions in a serverless environment. Firecracker uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to create and manage lightweight VMs called microVMs, which are optimized for security and speed.

## How Firecracker Helps Secure Programs

1. **Isolation**: Firecracker provides strong isolation between microVMs, ensuring that each workload runs in its own secure environment without interference from other workloads.
   
2. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Due to its minimalistic design, Firecracker has a small attack surface, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

3. **Fast Startup**: Firecracker microVMs boot up quickly, reducing the window of exposure to potential attacks.

4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Firecracker encourages the use of immutable infrastructure patterns, where VMs are treated as disposable entities. This reduces the risk of configuration drift and makes it easier to maintain a secure environment.

## Installing Firecracker

### Prerequisites

Before installing Firecracker, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Linux kernel version 4.14 or later
- KVM enabled in your kernel configuration
- `curl` and `jq` packages installed (for downloading and configuring Firecracker)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download Firecracker**:

   ```bash
   curl -LOJ https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/latest/download/firecracker
   chmod +x firecracker
   
2. **Download the Firecracker Jailer**:

   ```bash
   curl -LOJ https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/latest/download/jailer
   chmod +x jailer

3. **Move Firecracker and Jailer binaries to a directory in your PATH**:

   ```bash
   sudo mv firecracker jailer /usr/local/bin/

4. **Verify Installation**:

   ```bash
   firecracker --version
   jailer --version

You should see the version numbers of Firecracker and Jailer printed to the console if the installation was successful.

## Running Python Programs on Firecracker MicroVM

To run Python programs on a Firecracker microVM, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Root Filesystem Image**: You'll need a root filesystem image containing a minimal Linux environment and Python installed. You can use tools like debootstrap or buildroot to create this image.

2. **Start Firecracker with the RootFS Image**:
   
    ```bash
    ./firecracker --api-sock /tmp/firecracker.sock

3. **Launch a MicroVM Instance**:

   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i -X PUT 'http://localhost/machine-config' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "vcpu_count": 2, "mem_size_mib": 512 }'

4. **Attach the RootFS Image**:

   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i -X PUT 'http://localhost/drives/rootfs' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json -d '{ "drive_id": "rootfs", "path_on_host": "<path_to_rootfs_image>", "is_root_device": true, "is_read_only": false }'

5. **Start the MicroVM**:

   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket /tmp/firecracker.sock -i -X PUT 'http://localhost/actions' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "action_type": "InstanceStart" }'

6. **Connect to the MicroVM**:

   ```bash
   ssh <microVM_IP_address>

You can now run Python programs within the Firecracker microVM.

## Conclusion

Firecracker provides a lightweight and secure environment for running cloud workloads, making it an ideal choice for deploying and securing programs in a serverless environment. By following the installation and usage instructions provided in this README, you can leverage Firecracker to run Python programs securely in microVMs.
